        <div id="bio">
            <p>Although I was born in Chilliwack, BC, I lived most my life online, immersed in video games.
                In addition to League and Hearthstone, I love programming. This is why I joined the CST Program
                at BCIT where I hopes to graduate with a Bachelors in 2020. The area in Computing that I am
                most passionate about is Game Development. Needless to say, my favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
