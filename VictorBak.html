            <p>Victor was born in New Westminster and resides in Vancouver. He kind-of missed 
                school so he decided to enroll in CST. Victor is enjoying his time at BCIT since
                he loves to program and to graphic art with Photoshop. On his spare time he likes
                to do fun things like having a good time. Victor thoroughly enjoys eating Ramen.
