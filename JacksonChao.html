            <p>I graduated from SFU with a BBA in 2014. Upon graduating, I had very little luck in finding a job in my respective field ( a concentration in MIS and entrepreneurship ), so I decided to learn web programming. I spent the last year or so working for a startup as a full stack web developer, but I always wanted to learn more about computer systems itself. Funny thing- while you are in school you can't wait to graduate, but once you do, you want to go back. Long story short, I decided to go back to school in order to learn more advanced topics in computer science so I applied for BCIT's CST program and the rest is history.</p>
