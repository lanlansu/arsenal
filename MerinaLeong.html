            <p>Hello everyone! In June 2016, I graduated from Burnaby South Secondary. During my time there I took a few web
              development courses as well as AP Computer Science which covered Java. My very first job was delivering 80
              BurnabyNow newspapers twice a week, near the steep hill of Royal Oak and Marine Drive, with a terrible wage
              of $14 bi-weekly. I later worked at MJF Theatre as an usher, and developed a strong distaste for customer service.
              BUT I am still a social butterfly, and would like to get to know all of you :)
              PS: If you are ever at school after class, let me know! I'm usually here until 8pm and would love to work with you.
              Needless to say, Merina's favourite class is COMP1111. </p>
