            <p>Hey all, I'm Artur. I was born in Ukraine, later moved to Belgium for a few years, where I learned French. I don't have a lot of 
			computer background other than typical "googling" skills, which saved me many times from having to pay someone to solve my problems. 
			A bit of HTML and CSS background though, so I might be able to help the those confused. I have quite a lot of work experience with people 
			since I worked in places like Cineplex and PNE. However, I'm here, in CST because I'd like to learn multiple coding languages. If you 
			have anything to say, say it, and we'll talk! <p>Artur.</p>
            <p>Artur might be reached at gordiartur@gmail.com</p>
			<p>P.S. I don't know why my image isn't rotated properly</p>
