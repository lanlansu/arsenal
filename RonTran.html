            <p>Although Ron was born in Vietnam, he always considers Canada as his second homecountry. He loves to code and program, but he does not really know much. That's why
			Ron chose to come to BCIT to study coding. He likes to play sports, listen to music and watch anime. He hopes to become a good web developer in the future.</p>
